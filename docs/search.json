    "text": "The first afterschool programs began in the United States in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s due to change in youth demographics, increase in formal schooling and decrease in child labor (Halpern, 2002). At the beginning they were functioning as local clubs before evolving through the time in order to adjust to the need of the families. The creation of universal, compulsory education led to an extended period of discretionary time during the afterschool hours for children in the U.S. (Kleiber & Powell, 2005 as cited in Mahoney et al., 2009). It is only in 1994 that the Congress authorizes the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program to open schools up to broader use by their communities. Then in 1998, public schools in urban and rural areas were asked to open longer to provide a broad range of community services, including academic support and enrichment programs (You For Youth, n.d). Since then, afterschool programs have been around, and several organizations were created to help students’ overall development. These programs are believed to have several outcomes on students, so it is critical to assess them in a proper way to prove if they actually have an effect. The program we are going to assess in this evaluation is an afterschool tutoring program offered by the nonprofit After-School All-Stars to students from low-income neighborhoods."

    "text": "After-School All-Stars is a nonprofit organization that provides after-school programs to children in the United States. It was founded in 1992 by Mr. Schwarzenegger and Danny Hernandez founded as primarily a non-profit aimed to bring sports to at-risk youth nationwide. After expanding through the time and in different locations, the nonprofit converted its model to comprehensive afterschool programs and choose the name of “After-School All-Stars” (After-School All-Stars, n.d.).\n\n\n\nSTEM are part of the program\n\n\nAfter-School All-Stars helps students and supports working families through free, comprehensive after-school programs in cities across the nation. In 2021 After-School All-Stars served more 50,000 students and families from 13 different States and 53 Cities in the United States (After-School All-Stars, n.d.)."

    "text": "Based on the mission and vision statements of After-School All-Stars program, comprehensive free afterschool and summer programs can have several outcomes. First, it can contribute to keep the children safe when they are out of school.\nIn fact, according to The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (2006), the incidence of violent crimes committed by youth peaks in the hours immediately following the end of the school day, with close to 1 in 5 juvenile violent crimes taking place in the hours between 3 and 7 p.m. In addition, in their report, the Office found that the risk of violent juvenile victimization was 60 percent greater in the four hours after school than in the 8 p.m.-to-midnight period on non-school days (Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, 2006 as cited in Afterschool Alliance, 2014).\nSecondly, when children are kept in a safe environment, they can improve their grades and succeed at school, implying they graduate from High School and go to College. For instance, a national evaluation found that more than 40 percent of students attending 21st Century Community Learning Center programs improved their reading and math grades, and that those who attended more regularly were more likely to make gains (Naftzger et al., 2007 as cited in Youth.org, n.d.).\nMoreover, success at school and early career development exposure can lead to success in career. Some researchers pointed out that developing some soft skills are essential for work force development and lead to more youth being hired and successful in their jobs (Lippman, Ryberg, Carney, & Moore, 2015 as cited in Youth.org, n.d.).\nFinally, according to the theory behind the program, success in career can lead to success in life.\n\n\n\nTheory of change for After-School All-Stars program"

However, the outputs of some activities are difficult to really capture the intended outcomes. In fact, some outcomes such as success in career are a little bit far away and require a long term tracking of attendance through during a long period of time. Because students are not required to attend those programs, if they are not regular, and involved in the process, there is a risk that no changes or lasting effects occur.\n\n\n\nLogic model for After-School All-Stars program Table\n\n\n\n\n\nLogic model for After-School All-Stars program"

Socioeconomic, Location and ability to learn need to be controlled for. I also included background and improved mental health. I included background because it determines the socioeconomic conditions of one. Socioeconomic will determine if one attend after school programs. In fact, students from under resources family will be more likely to attend the program. Also, students from privilege socioeconomic condition are more likely to perform better at school. In addition, location determines also if one will attend or not due to the distance. Students from rich neighborhood will be more likely to have good grades than those from lower income neighborhood. Finally, attending After school programs can improve students’ mental health because they are participating in activity they like and are in a safe environment. Improved mental health as a result would lead to improvement of grades.\nThe frontdoor paths are:\n• After School - Improved mental health - Improved grades\n• After School - Improved grades\nThe backdoor paths are:\n• AfterSchool < - Location - > Improved grades\n• AfterSchool < - Ability to learn - > Improved grades\n• AfterSchool < - Socioeconomic - > Improved grades\nAccording to our DAG, the variables we need to be controlled for / adjusted to close the backdoors are background/socioecomomic, Location, and Ability to learn. We can use a statistical method to perform this adjustment."

Based on our DAG, we know that the confounding nodes are Location, Background, and Ability to learn. In our program we operationalize Location as the distance from students ’home to school in miles. Background will be identified as the number of siblings students have and Ability to learn will be measured as their previous GPA before the program.\nOur analysis approach will be Inverse Probability Weighing. We are going to assign every student some probability of enrolling in the afterschool tutoring program, and then weight each observation by its inverse probability. First, we generate scores which represent the probability of attending the afterschool tutoring program and second use a special formula to convert those scores into weights. Finally, we will use a regression model after incorporating in it the inverse probability weights we have found."

    "text": "We attempted to measure the effect of attending the after-school all-star tutoring program on students’ final GPA. We know that some other variables may confound this relationship, so we started by closing these paths. Location, Siblings (as a measure of background) and GPA (as a measure of ability to learn) can affect the probability of a student to attend the afterschool program. In fact, students who are far from school may not be able to attend the afterschool program as it is in the school building, and they cannot stay late because of transportation issue. Also, students with many siblings will be more likely to attend the tutoring as they parents may not be able to work with every child. Finally, previous performances in class may lead one to enroll or not in the program. Students with lower GPA may lean toward enrolling in the program. Based on our confounders, we predicted the probability of every student in our dataset to enroll in the program or not. After predicting these probabilities (weights), we used them to estimate the effect of our program on the final GPA.\n\n\n\nGraph of the effect of the After-School All-Stars program\n\n\nOur regression estimate is 0.754, meaning the program increased the final GPA by 0.75 points on average, which is the effect of the Afterschool tutoring program.\n\n\n\nCausal effect of the After-School All-Stars program"

    "text": "We were able to show that the afterschool tutoring program has a positive effect on the GPA of the attendants. In fact, our analyses have found that the program improved the grades of the students which was the desired effect of the Afterschool-all-star program. Not only literature from past decades have pointed out the positive outcomes of afterschool/tutoring programs, but also through our research, we were able to find that indeed such programs have positive effect, and those findings were statistically significant. Therefore, we recommend that the Afterschool/ tutoring program should be funded in order to help more struggling students that cannot afford tutoring by themselves to better perform in school."
